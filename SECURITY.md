# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

MechanicsDSL includes an exec()-free compiler architecture designed to prevent arbitrary code execution from DSL files. However, if you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., AST injection, path traversal), please report it responsibly.

- Do **not** open a public issue.
- Instead, email the project maintainer directly at [mechanicsdsl.project@gmail.com](mailto:mechanicsdsl.project@gmail.com).
- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a patch.
