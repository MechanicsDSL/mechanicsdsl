How to contribute
1. Fork the repo.

Guidelines
- Follow the project's coding style (PEP 8).
- Include unit tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Keep PRs focused and small for easier review.

Issue triage
- Use issue labels (bug, enhancement, docs).
- If you want to work on an issue, comment "working on this" to avoid duplication.

Communication
- Use the issue tracker for design discussion.
- For quick chat / informal mentoring, email the project lead listed in the README.
