# MechanicsDSL — Project Brief (one page)

Mission
MechanicsDSL provides a safe, extensible, and easy-to-use domain-specific language and toolchain to define, symbolically derive, numerically simulate, and visualize classical mechanical systems. It lowers the barrier for researchers, instructors, and students to prototype mechanics models with correct symbolic derivations and robust numerical execution.

What it does
- Accepts compact LaTeX-like model descriptions (variables, parameters, Lagrangians, constraints).
- Produces symbolic equations (Euler–Lagrange, Hamiltonian), numeric ODE code, and animations.
- Validates physics (energy conservation, analytic comparison), and supports unit checking.

Why it matters
- Bridges symbolic math (SymPy) and numerical simulation (SciPy) in a secure and reproducible workflow.
- Useful for computational physics education, rapid prototyping in research, and reproducible demonstrations in policy/engineering contexts.

Asks (initial)
- Community contributors: code, docs, examples, notebooks.
- Demo adopters: university instructors, computational-lab courses.
- Fiscal or infrastructure support: cloud credits, CI sponsorship, or a fiscal sponsor for donation acceptance.
